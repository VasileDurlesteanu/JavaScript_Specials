# JavaScript_Specials
A summary of the JavaScript Special Chapter by Ilya Kantor

## Code Structure
Statements are delimited with a semicolon:
``` JavaScript
alert('Hello'); alert('World');
```

Usually, a line-break is also treated as a delimiter, so that would also work:
``` JavaScript
alert('Hello')
alert('World')
```
## Strict mode
To fully enable all features of modern JavaScript, we should start scripts with "use strict".
``` JavaScript
'use strict';
....
```
